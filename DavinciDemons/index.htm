The connection of the right facial muscles to the left hemisphere
and the left facial muscles to the right hemisphere is called contra-
lateral functioning.
Think of Mona Lisa. The right side of her face is smiling, but the
left side of her face indicates a neutral or negative emotion. This
difference can be seen more clearly if you paste together two left
sides of her face and two right sides of her face.
Since the left hemisphere processes more positive emotions and
the right hemisphere processes more negative emotions, those emo-
tions are reflected in each side of the face.
Thus, when you force a smile or a frown, you’re triggering the
feelings associated with happiness or sadness. By smiling or frown-
ing you send messages to your subcortical and cortical areas that
resonate with happy or sad feelings. So put on a happy face—it
helps you to feel better!Click on the left or the left or right side of the Monalisa below
to learn more about each side's function.
