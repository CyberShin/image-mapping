"Behold," Teabing proclaimed, "the greatest cover-up in human history. Not only was Jesus Christ married,
but He was a father. My dear, Mary Magdalene was the Holy Vessel. She was the chalice that bore the royal
bloodline of Jesus Christ. She was the womb that bore the lineage, and the vine from which the sacred fruit sprang
forth!"
Sophie felt the hairs stand up on her arms. "But how could a secret that big be kept quiet all of these years?"
"Heavens!" Teabing said. "It has been anything but quiet! The royal bloodline of Jesus Christ is the source of
the most enduring legend of all time—the Holy Grail. Magdalene's story has been shouted from the rooftops for
centuries in all kinds of metaphors and languages. Her story is everywhere once you open your eyes."
"And the Sangreal documents?" Sophie said. "They allegedly contain proof that Jesus had a royal bloodline?"
"They do."
"So the entire Holy Grail legend is all about royal blood?"
"Quite literally," Teabing said. "The word Sangreal derives from San Greal—or Holy Grail. But in its most
ancient form, the word Sangreal was divided in a different spot." Teabing wrote on a piece of scrap paper and
handed it to her.
She read what he had written.
Sang Real
Instantly, Sophie recognized the translation. Sang Real literally meant Royal Blood

<p>One of the deep secrets suggested in the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail in 1982 and made popular
by The Da Vinci Code was that the Templars discovered and protected the bloodline of Jesus, who
was thought to have fathered a child by Mary Magdalene. This reportedly began a dynasty of secret
descendants of Jesus, with serious repercussions for the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>T h e Priory of Sion (also the Prieure de Sion) is said to be the "secret society
1of societies." Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln, authors of one acclaimed
book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, write that the brotherhood of the Priory of
Sion has been preserved for two millennia. France's royal Merovingian Dynasty's
bloodline is said to be the protector of the sect, which boasts that it is the actual
bloodline of Jesus. The astonishing claim is that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were
married and had children and from this bloodline shall someday arise a man who
shall become the ruler of planet earth.

<p>Some teach that as the blood of Jesus oozed from his
body on the cross, it was collected in the Holy Grail cup. Esoterically that would
make the Holy Grail, if it exists, magical and capable of great miracles.
A variation of this story is that the Holy Grail was the drinking vessel of Jesus at
the Last Supper, which again would translate into the cup being a magical talisman.
